/**
 * STB Image Implementation
 * * This file is required to create the implementation for the header-only library.
 * The CMake build system will compile this file to object code which is then 
 * linked into the main executable.

#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_image.h"

// If you need other stb libraries (like stb_image_write.h), 
// you can define their implementations here as well:

// #define STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION
// #include "stb_image_write.h"
